description: Ascalaphidae is a family of insects in the order Neuroptera, generally called owlflies. They are fast-flying crepuscular or diurnal predators of other flying insects, and have large bulging eyes and strongly knobbed antennae. The larvae are ambush predators; some of them make use of self-decoration camouflage.
